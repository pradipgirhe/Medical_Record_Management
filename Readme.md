# Medical Record Management with Patient Control

## Introduction

The **Medical Record Management with Patient Control** project is a blockchain-based solution built using **Aptos** and the **Move** programming language. This system allows patients to securely manage and control access to their medical records. It provides a decentralized and immutable way to store medical data, giving patients full control over who can access their sensitive healthcare information.

Using this smart contract, a patient can create their own medical record, which consists of their personal health data (represented as a byte vector). Patients can also manage who has access to their medical records by authorizing specific addresses. This ensures that only trusted parties can view or modify the data, improving privacy and security compared to traditional centralized systems.

## Vision of the Project

The vision of the project is to build a **decentralized healthcare ecosystem** where patients have full autonomy over their medical records and can securely share their data with healthcare providers, family members, or trusted individuals as needed. By leveraging blockchain's transparency and immutability, the project aims to:

- Empower patients to manage their own medical records.
- Provide a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof system for storing healthcare data.
- Offer patients the ability to share access with healthcare providers or others, without the risk of data manipulation or unauthorized access.
- Ensure data privacy and control remain in the hands of the patient, reducing the need for intermediaries.

## Future Goals of the Project

The current implementation is just the beginning, and there are several areas of improvement and features that could be added to enhance the functionality and utility of this system:

1. **Data Encryption**: To ensure the confidentiality of medical records, sensitive data should be encrypted. Only authorized addresses will have access to the decryption keys, allowing for private medical record sharing.
   
2. **Revoking Access**: Allow patients to revoke previously granted access to their medical records. This would provide more control, ensuring that patients can remove access to their medical records at any time.

3. **Integration with Healthcare Providers**: Extend the system to allow healthcare providers (e.g., hospitals, doctors) to upload, update, or modify medical records. This could create a comprehensive digital health record for patients, continuously updated by healthcare professionals.

4. **Interoperability with Other Systems**: The project could integrate with other healthcare systems or blockchain networks, making it easier to share medical records across different platforms while maintaining privacy and control.

5. **Audit and Transparency**: Introduce features that log access and modifications to medical records, creating a full audit trail that ensures transparency and accountability.

6. **Smart Contract Upgrades**: Future versions could include more complex access control models, better handling of medical record versioning, and integration with decentralized identity (DID) solutions for better user authentication and security.

## Deployed Address of the Project

As of now, this project is still in the development phase, and the contract has not been deployed to a public network. Once the contract is deployed to the **Aptos testnet** or **mainnet**, the deployed address will be updated here for public access and usage.

**Deployed Address**: 0x4ac83b9d7fd4d40e92b900f798af538f290557f6a3a88ca4beb888eb13a0c8ae

### Conclusion

This project offers a simple, secure, and decentralized method for patients to store and control access to their medical records on the Aptos blockchain. With further development, this system can pave the way for a more patient-centric healthcare data management solution, ensuring privacy, security, and control over personal health information.
